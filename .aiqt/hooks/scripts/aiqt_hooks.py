"""AIQT Guardrails enforcement hooks for Claude Code. Stdlib only, offline.

SOURCE tree copy: this file lives at .aiqt/core/hooks/scripts/aiqt_hooks.py and is copied
byte-identical into the generated plugin surface plugin/aiqt-guardrails-hooks/hooks/scripts/
aiqt_hooks.py by tools/gen_hooks.py; edit the source, never the generated copy. One dispatcher, one
handler function per control declared in .aiqt/core/hooks/manifest.toml:

  diff_wall_stop      Stop        cnsdif  surface (WARN) a unified-diff wall in the final assistant message
  diff_source_pretool PreToolUse  cnsdif  deny a Bash command that dumps a bare console diff
  commit_identity     PreToolUse  cmtidn  deny a git authoring command that names an AI identity
  absolute_paths      PreToolUse  abspth  deny a relative path where a typed-path tool requires absolute
  bash_absolute_paths PreToolUse  abspth  ask on a relative cd/pushd operand or redirect target in Bash
  git_discard         PreToolUse  prsunc  allow/ask/deny a git command that would discard uncommitted work
  branch_root         PreToolUse  brnrot  block branch creation from an orphaned start point
  gate_weakening      PreToolUse  gatdis  deny a git hook bypass; ask a swallowed or truncated checker
  commit_msg_subst    PreToolUse  sectvl  ask on shell substitution in a git commit argument
  secrets_shift_left  PreToolUse  secsec  deny a Write/Edit/MultiEdit/Bash writing an obvious hardcoded secret
  gensrc_guard        PreToolUse  gensrc  a Write/Edit/MultiEdit that hand-edits a registered generated artefact

Contract (doc-confirmed 2026-08-17 against code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks): the hook payload arrives
as JSON on stdin. A PreToolUse handler that decides emits, on exit 0,
{"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "PreToolUse", "permissionDecision": "allow"|"deny",
"permissionDecisionReason": "..."}}; an allow decision is expressed as NO output (exit 0 silent), so
the user's own permission flow is never bypassed, and a deny decision blocks the tool. exit 2 is a
blocking error whose stderr is fed back to Claude. The Stop payload carries the final assistant text
as last_assistant_message (there is NO stop_hook_active field in the current Stop payload).

Error posture at the PreToolUse layer: FAIL CLOSED, for every control EXCEPT git_discard (whose
deliberate boundary posture is stated next), gensrc_guard (a second stated exception, below), and
commit_msg_subst (a third stated exception, below). A
fail-closed control that cannot read the input it is meant
to cover, or is invoked in a context it does not understand, DENIES rather than waving the action
through (per integ-check-fails-closed-on-unreadable): a missing tool_name, an unreadable command
string, or an unreadable required field all deny. A detected violation denies the same way. A clean
pass emits NO decision and exits 0 silently.

gensrc_guard (gensrc) is the SECOND stated exception: it is a registry-driven path ASK whose strongest
outcome on a confirmed violation is itself an ask (the human approving IS the opt-out), so every branch
it cannot clear fails SAFE to ASK rather than deny, because a branch that denied on uncertainty would
punish uncertainty harder than certainty. An unreadable, malformed, or unknown-version registry, an
unresolvable repo root, a target that canonicalizes outside the repo, and an unreadable payload field
all ASK; an absent registry is the inert ALLOW; and only a missing tool_name denies (the shared
fail-closed contract). The ASK still satisfies integ-check-fails-closed-on-unreadable in substance:
the failure surfaces as a gate the human must clear and can never read as clean.

commit_msg_subst (sectvl) is the THIRD stated exception: its strongest normal finding is an ASK, so a
missing or unreadable command string also fails safe to ASK rather than being punished more harshly than
a confirmed substitution. Only a missing tool_name denies under the shared fail-closed contract; a
mis-wired event still hard-blocks because no structured PreToolUse decision can safely be formed.

git_discard (prsunc) is a DELIBERATE, ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE "ask unless PRISTINE and provably clean" exception
to that fail-closed rule (EN-6). It has THREE outcomes: ALLOW (exit 0 silent), DENY, and ASK
(permissionDecision "ask", which prompts the human). UNLIKE the fail-closed controls above, it fails OPEN
(ALLOW) at the TRUE BOUNDARY - a non-Bash or absent tool, a malformed or missing tool_input.command it
cannot read as a discard, a non-git command, or no recognized lossy verb - because none of those is a
discard it can reason about, and it never silently allows a recognized WORKING-TREE-CONTENT discard (a
recognized verb in a genuinely non-destructive FORM - checkout -b, reset --soft, clean -n - preserves the
index and worktree content, though reset --soft still MOVES HEAD, a reflog-recoverable ref move, so it
discards no working-tree content and may ALLOW even on a dirty tree, as detailed below). That no-silent-allow
guarantee is bounded to WORKING-TREE CONTENT and is best-effort, not categorical: some ref-level moves (a
merged-branch delete, reset --soft moving HEAD) are reflog-recoverable, and the obfuscation/config residuals
disclosed below (a fragmented git command word or verb, a git alias, ambient config) can hide a discard the
lexical scan never sees. An UNPARSEABLE command
(unbalanced quote) is not a free pass, it is scanned raw for a lossy verb keyword and ASKS when one is
present. WITHIN scope (a recognized lossy verb: checkout/switch/restore/reset/clean/stash/
rm/branch) the outcome is ASK unless the command is a PRISTINE SINGLE BARE 'git <verb>' invocation AND the
tree is provably clean (or the leading opt-out is set, or the form is genuinely non-destructive). PRISTINE
SINGLE BARE means, PURELY LEXICALLY (the bash grammar is never parsed): after optional leading KEY=value
assignments the command is exactly 'git <args>' as ONE simple command, and the RAW string carries NO shell
metacharacter anywhere EVEN INSIDE QUOTES (none of ; | & < > ( ) { } $ backtick backslash ! newline, which
also rules out &&/||/|&, every redirection form, and every command/process substitution), no shell reserved
word, and a command word that is LITERALLY 'git' (not a path, not a wrapper such as sudo/nice/timeout/nohup/
env/command/exec/builtin/xargs/time/!/sh -c/bash -c). ANY shell metacharacter, wrapper, redirect, reserved
word, or second command makes the command not-pristine - a PURELY LEXICAL determination - and it ASKS
WITHOUT ever consulting the probe (a safe over-ask). An option the form-classifier cannot resolve is a
SEPARATE mechanism and does NOT bear on pristineness: a pristine command carrying an unresolved option still
reaches the probe, where its role routes to a scoped ASK, so it is not silently allowed either. A wrapper is
caught only while the raw scan still sees a contiguous git verb keyword, so 'any wrapper ASKS' is NOT
categorical (a wrapper that ALSO fragments the verb is a disclosed residual, below). Only a
metacharacter-free 'git <verb> <plain args>'
reaches the probe, where PROVABLY CLEAN means the read-only, config-forced porcelain probe (git -c
status.showUntrackedFiles=all status --porcelain --untracked-files=all, so a repo-local
status.showUntrackedFiles=no cannot hide an untracked file) reports NO tracked change AND NO untracked ('??')
entry (only an ignored '!!' entry counts as clean). A pristine bare whole-tree clobber (reset --hard,
checkout -f, switch --force/--discard-changes) on a probed-dirty tree DENIES; everything else in scope ASKS.
No recognized lossy verb that would discard WORKING-TREE CONTENT is silently ALLOWED except a pristine bare
'git <verb>' whose FORM is genuinely non-destructive (checkout -b, reset --soft, clean -n, which ALLOW even
on a dirty tree), or on a provably-clean tree, or a pristine bare form carrying the leading
GUARDRAIL_ALLOW_DISCARD=1 opt-out - worst case it ASKS, at the cost of more asks. This guarantee is bounded to
working-tree content: ref-level moves (reset --soft moving HEAD, a merged-branch delete) are reflog-
recoverable, and the obfuscation/config residuals below are best-effort, not categorical. The HONEST RESIDUAL a lexical hook cannot catch: a git alias or shell
function renaming git; deliberate token fragmentation or obfuscation of the COMMAND WORD 'git' ITSELF or of
the verb (a wrapper whose git command word or verb is SPLIT so neither the token scan nor the raw scan sees
a contiguous git+verb keyword, e.g. env git re'set' --hard, eval git re'set', or command g'it' reset --hard
/ env /usr/bin/g'it' reset --hard, whose raw string carries no contiguous 'git'+'reset', reads as 'no
recognized lossy verb' and is silently ALLOWED - a best-effort residual, not chased); a real discard whose
VERB is outside the recognized set AND the raw scan does NOT flag at all (a 'git worktree remove -f' of a
dirty linked worktree discards that worktree's uncommitted work, yet 'worktree' matches no lossy keyword, so
it is allowed at the true boundary - disclosed, not closed this round). A command the raw scan DOES flag as
in-scope whose resolved subcommand is nonetheless outside the recognized set ('git checkout-index -a -f',
'git read-tree -u --reset HEAD', flagged by their 'checkout'/'reset' substring) is NO LONGER silently
allowed: it ASKS (F-97), since a flagged sub the classifier cannot resolve to a known verb cannot be proven
non-destructive. A discard performed outside the Bash tool; or
persistent shell/config state; the deferred recovery/snapshot layer is the backstop. The one probe kept is
read-only and offline; it never mutates the repo.

Stop layer is a DELIBERATE exception, non-blocking by design (GD-24 tri-family QA, 2026-08-17,
flagged for Architect review): it SURFACES a diff wall with a strong systemMessage and exits 0 (WARN),
it does NOT hard-block. The wall has already rendered by Stop time, so blocking cannot unsend it; and
because there is no stop_hook_active field and no documented built-in loop bound, a hard exit-2 Stop
block could re-fire on the forced continuation and wedge the session. The hard PREVENTION for console
diffs lives in the PreToolUse diff_source layer at the command source; the Stop layer only surfaces.

This is enforced at the DISPATCHER, not left to the handler alone: main() reads each handler's event
class from HANDLER_EVENT (the argv mode, never the payload, which may be unreadable) and, for a
Stop/SubagentStop handler, converts EVERY error path (a bad argv count, unreadable/malformed stdin, a
JSON parse failure, a non-dict payload, or a handler crash) into a non-blocking systemMessage warning
on exit 0. No Stop invocation reaches exit 2 on an ERROR path; a Stop handler may still return exit 2 as a
DELIBERATE decision where the platform documents exit 2 as the block (the orchestration stop guard denies a
manufactured wind-down that way, doc-confirmed 2026-08-29, bounded by its own loop bound so it cannot wedge
the chain). Outside that deliberate deny, only a PreToolUse handler fails closed via exit 2, and only a
genuinely UNKNOWN mode (not in HANDLERS, an unidentifiable broken install) does so on a bad invocation.

# --- shared raw-command tokenizer (quote/redirect-aware) ---------------------------------------------
# ONE raw-character lexical pass over the Bash command, shared by every lexical Bash hook (diff-source,
# commit-identity, protected-line, gate-weakening, and git-discard's lossy scan). It decides quoting and
# REDIRECTION from RAW character positions and quote provenance BEFORE any token stream exists, so a shell
# redirection ANYWHERE in a command (leading, interspersed, or trailing: 'git >/dev/null commit', '>out
# pytest') is recorded as redirect metadata and REMOVED from the argv the handlers judge, closing the
# post-tokenize redirect-pollution class shared across the hooks. A naive post-tokenize strip was proven
# unsafe (a quoted '>' or a numeric option value was over-stripped into a silent allow, prtbrn round-10
# revert), so the strip happens HERE, from raw positions, where quote provenance and fd adjacency are still
# visible - never reconstructed from already-tokenized words.
#
# It is a LEXER, not a shell parser: it models the recognized redirection and separator grammar and, for
# any construct it does not model - a heredoc ('<<'/'<<-'), a here-string ('<<<'), a process substitution
# ('<('/'>('), a '{fd}>' redirect, a malformed or unterminated redirect, an unbalanced quote or escape,
# or a NUL - it RAISES ValueError so the caller falls back to its conservative raw scan rather than
# returning partial argv (never a partially-cleaned command). An expansion or command substitution ('$',
# '$( )', backtick) or a glob/brace/tilde is not modelled either: it marks the segment OPAQUE (the same

# Layer A of the F-36 catch, redesigned FAIL-SAFE-BY-CONSTRUCTION (GD-112 AIRTIGHT-NARROW philosophy, the
# same one applied to the truncation guard): rather than enumerating every dumping form of git (an
# unbounded shell + git-option grammar, GD-34/F-119), it proves the SAFE form or DENIES/ASKS. It works on
# the shared quote/redirect-aware tokenizer (_lex_command), so a redirection anywhere in the command is
# recorded as metadata and removed from argv, closing the redirect-pollution class. A git diff-PRODUCER is
# ALLOWED only when the WHOLE command matches one of FOUR closed proofs: (A) an exact metacharacter-free
# help invocation (git <producer> --help/-h); (B) an exact summary-only command (a metacharacter-free
# 'git <producer> ... --stat/--name-only/...' whose only other option may be --no-patch); (C) a single
# simple command whose command word is literally 'git', a possible producer, whose LAST stdout redirect is
# proven to land on a static non-/dev,/proc file (last-redirect-wins over the raw redirect metadata); or
# (D) an exact two-stage terminal pager pipeline 'git <producer> | less/more/most/pager'. A producer that
# is confirmed to emit a console patch (a default diff/show/range-diff, or a patch-flagged listing) and
# fits no proof DENIES; any other producer-capable-but-unproven form (a wrapper, a pathed git, quotes, a
# compound, extra summary modifiers, a dynamic redirect target, a pipe to a non-pager) ASKS. The ALLOW path
# deliberately does NOT parse the full git/shell option grammar, so it over-ASKS (a git log carrying any
# extra flag, quoted prose) rather than risk a false ALLOW; the residual is disclosed in the manifest. A

# switch incl -C/--force-create, restore/reset/clean/stash drop-clear/rm/branch force delete/move/copy/reset)
# the outcome is ASK unless the command is a PRISTINE SINGLE
# BARE 'git <verb>' invocation on a PROVABLY CLEAN tree (or, for that same pristine form, the LEADING opt-out
# is set). Three outcomes:
#   ALLOW  exit 0 silent  - the true boundary (a non-git command, no recognized lossy verb, an
#                           unparseable command with no lossy verb keyword); OR a PRISTINE SINGLE BARE
#                           'git <verb>' whose FORM is genuinely non-destructive (a bare no-op, reset
#                           --soft, an unforced branch-create, clean -n, stash push, branch -d); OR a
#                           PRISTINE SINGLE BARE lossy 'git <verb>' on a PROVABLY CLEAN tree (the config-
#                           forced porcelain probe reports no tracked change AND no untracked entry), so
#                           there is nothing to discard; OR the LEADING opt-out on that same pristine form.
#   DENY   permissionDecision deny - a PRISTINE SINGLE BARE WHOLE-TREE-clobbering verb (reset --hard,
#                           checkout -f with no pathspec, switch --force/--discard-changes) on a tree the
#                           probe confirms is dirty: the loss is certain.
#   ASK    permissionDecision ask  - EVERYTHING else in scope. This is deliberately the common outcome:
#                           ANY command that is not a pristine single bare git invocation - ANY shell
#                           metacharacter anywhere (even quoted), ANY wrapper/redirect/reserved-word/
#                           compound, a first command word that is not literally 'git', or an option the
#                           form-classifier cannot resolve - ASKS without ever consulting the probe; and a
#                           pristine lossy form on a not-provably-clean tree (tracked OR untracked change),
#                           a worktree the guard cannot resolve to the session cwd, a status probe that did
#                           not complete, or a softer/index-only discard (clean of untracked files, stash
#                           drop/clear, branch -D, restore --staged, mixed/path reset, rm --cached) also ASKS.
# The gate is PURELY LEXICAL and never parses the bash grammar: the presence of any shell metacharacter in a
# lossy-verb command is treated as a reason to ASK (a safe over-ask), so ONLY a metacharacter-free
# 'git <verb> <plain args>' ever reaches the probe. This closes the residual silent-allows that survived the
# coarse cut (a shell 'if'/'for', a backtick or '$()' substitution, a '|&' or leading/interspersed redirect,
# and ANY wrapper in front of git - sudo/stdbuf/doas/setsid/eval/sh -c/...: the raw 'git'+work-losing-verb
# scan is trusted UNCONDITIONALLY, not an enumerated wrapper list, so an un-listed wrapper is caught): ASK.
# That "cannot slip" is NOT categorical: a wrapper that ALSO fragments the command word 'git' or the verb so
# neither the token scan nor the raw scan sees a contiguous git+verb keyword reads as "no recognized lossy
# verb" and is silently ALLOWED (a DISCLOSED best-effort residual, see the module docstring; GD-34
# do-not-chase). The raw scan also OVER-ASKS in the SAFE direction: a command that merely CONTAINS a git
# token and a lossy verb as TEXT while running no discard ('echo git branch', 'git log | grep branch') still
# ASKS; narrowing that is the whack-a-mole GD-34 rejected, so the over-ask is disclosed, not chased.
# The status probe (git -c status.showUntrackedFiles=all status --porcelain --untracked-files=all) is
# read-only and offline and FORCES untracked reporting so a repo-local status.showUntrackedFiles=no config
# cannot hide an untracked file. The classifier never mutates working state; BENEATH it, the EN-6 recovery
# layer (see the block comment above _SNAPSHOTTABLE_VERBS) is SIDE-EFFECTING - it writes an inert
# refs/aiqt-recovery/* snapshot ref and an external ledger for a not-provably-clean discard - but writes only
# git objects and one private ref, never the real index, worktree, HEAD, or a branch. HONEST RESIDUAL (not
# caught by a lexical hook): a git alias or shell function that renames git, a discard performed outside the
# Bash tool, or persistent shell/config state set in a prior turn; the recovery/snapshot layer backstops a
# discard it CAN see, but cannot snapshot content the probe itself cannot see (assume-unchanged/skip-worktree
# marks or submodule.<name>.ignore hide work from the probe) nor ignored files (git add --all excludes them).

# --- the one probe kept: the coarse whole-tree clean signal ------------------------------------------

# The ambient git environment could redirect a real-state git call (the clean probe, the recovery
# snapshot) to a DECOY repository, inject config into it, hide content from it, or make a "read-only" call
# WRITE a trace file: an inherited GIT_* var can point git at a different index, object store, work tree,
# ref namespace, or discovery boundary than the one at `-C <repo>` (producing a false "provably clean", a
# false recovery point, or a dirty-tree ALLOW left unchanged), propagate config through the `git -c`
# GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS channel (able to hide untracked content via core.excludesFile or inject a
# filter.*.clean that runs during the snapshot `git add --all`), suppress system config via
# GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM, redirect attribute lookup through GIT_ATTR_SOURCE, or (git treats an absolute
# GIT_TRACE value as a FILE PATH and APPENDS trace output to it) make even the read-only status probe and
# the recovery git calls WRITE a file, possibly inside the protected worktree, violating the read-only/inert
# posture. Rather than ENUMERATE this family (rounds 4-5 kept finding new members: GIT_CONFIG_*, then
# GIT_TRACE*, then GIT_ATTR_SOURCE), every real-state call takes an ALLOWLIST posture: _isolate_git_env
# scrubs EVERY ambient GIT_*-prefixed var before the caller applies its own env, so after the scrub a
# real-state call observes the ACTUAL repo at `-C <repo>` rather than an ambient-env decoy and writes no
# trace file; a snapshot call's own GIT_INDEX_FILE (supplied via env_extra) still wins because env_extra is
# applied AFTER the scrub. This is BOUNDED, not categorical: the allowlist scrub closes the whole ambient-env
# class at once, but the residual is NOT limited to on-disk config - it spans the non-GIT_ environment
# (HOME/XDG_CONFIG_HOME/PATH/TMPDIR), on-disk git configuration AND attributes (repo/global/system .gitconfig
# and .gitattributes), index and ignore state, submodules and embedded repos, configured hooks and filters,
# PATH-based git resolution, and partial-clone object availability, all of which git reads by design and none
# neutralized here.


# The FIXED INTERNAL identity the recovery snapshot's `git commit-tree` commits under. The allowlist scrub
# strips every ambient GIT_* (including any GIT_AUTHOR_*/GIT_COMMITTER_*) AND neutralizes on-disk config's
# reach for the call, so with no ambient identity re-applied commit-tree would FALL BACK to user.name/email
# and then FAIL on a host that has none (a CI runner or a fresh install with no global gitconfig), silently
# disabling the recovery backstop there. Re-applying this fixed identity after the scrub makes commit-tree
# depend on NO ambient state; a deterministic identity is also correct on its own terms, since a recovery
# commit is attributed to the guard, not to the user. The address is a fixed non-routable localhost one.

# --- the recovery/snapshot layer (EN-6): an INERT git-DB sealed-epoch snapshot -----------------------
# BENEATH the ultra-conservative classifier sits a recovery layer that makes a discard RECOVERABLE. Before
# git_discard returns its decision for an in-scope lossy verb whose worktree it can resolve to the session
# cwd AND whose tree is NOT provably clean, it takes an INERT snapshot of the uncommitted work, on the ALLOW
# and the ASK paths alike (the hook fires once at PreToolUse; there is no post-approval callback, so a
# discard that is asked-then-approved, or one wrongly allowed by a classifier mis-parse, must ALREADY have a
# recovery point). The snapshot is decision-INDEPENDENT by design: it does not trust the form-classifier to
# be right about which forms are safe, so it fires for every snapshottable verb on a not-provably-clean tree
# regardless of the allow/ask/deny verdict. It is skipped when the tree is PROVABLY CLEAN (nothing the probe
# can see to lose), when the command is not in scope, and for stash/branch (a worktree snapshot cannot
# capture stash entries or branch commits; ref-pinning for those is a separate, deferred mechanism).
# F-D EXPANSION: a NON-PRISTINE in-scope ASK (a compound/wrapped/redirected snapshottable command) is now
# also snapshot-backed BEST-EFFORT against the SESSION CWD repo, so an asked-then-approved wrapped discard is
# recoverable too. It is best-effort because a non-pristine command's redirected dir is NOT parsed: a command
# that changes into a DIFFERENT repository may be snapshotted at the session repo rather than the target (a
# same-repo cd is still captured by the whole-tree `git add --all`); on snapshot fail the decision stays ASK.
#
# Mechanism (all stdlib/subprocess, offline): the repo TOPLEVEL is resolved once (the anchor for the size
# estimate and the inside-the-repo containment checks, since status paths are toplevel-relative and the cwd
# may be a subdir); a TEMPORARY GIT_INDEX_FILE in a throwaway dir normally OUTSIDE the toplevel (best-effort
# and guarded: the snapshot FAILS rather than write inside the tree when TMPDIR resolves within it), seeded
# by COPYING the real index (so staged content is the baseline); `git add --all` into that temp index
# overlays tracked-modified and UNTRACKED content (ignored excluded); `git write-tree` (temp index) -> a
# tree; `git commit-tree <tree> [-p HEAD]` -> a snapshot commit; then a CREATE-ONLY `git update-ref
# refs/aiqt-recovery/<utc-ts>-<pid> <sha> ""` (empty expected-old value: a name collision FAILS the snapshot
# rather than clobbering a prior recovery ref) protects it from GC.
#
# The BOUND on "inert" (honest framing): the snapshot's OWN git operations write only git objects and one
# private ref (plus a reflog entry for that ref when core.logAllRefUpdates=always, or when a reflog already
# exists for the ref) and do NOT themselves
# modify the real index, worktree, HEAD, or any branch; the ref is invisible to plain `git status`, `git
# branch`, and `git log`, THOUGH reachable via `git log --all` / `git for-each-ref refs/aiqt-recovery` /
# `git show-ref` (a real ref, not hidden). The selftest asserts the real status/index/HEAD, index bytes,
# config, and stash list are unchanged. Every real-state call in this layer scrubs EVERY ambient GIT_*-prefixed
# var (_isolate_git_env, the allowlist posture), so an ambient GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS injection, a
# GIT_ATTR_SOURCE redirect, or a GIT_TRACE file-write vector cannot reach these calls; the residual is NOT
# limited to on-disk config - it spans the non-GIT_ environment (HOME/XDG_CONFIG_HOME/PATH/TMPDIR), on-disk
# git configuration AND attributes (repo/global/system), index and ignore state, submodules and embedded
# repos, configured hooks and filters, PATH-based git resolution, and partial-clone object availability, all
# read by git by design. BUT git may ADDITIONALLY run any git-configured (repo, global,
# system, or command-scope) program during the
# snapshot, whose effects are OUTSIDE this guard's control, so the inert guarantee is BOUNDED, not
# categorical: a clean/process filter runs on `git add --all` (the CHECK-IN / clean direction, NOT smudge -
# smudge would run only on a restore/checkout), an fsmonitor hook runs on the `git status` probe, a
# reference-transaction hook AND a post-index-change hook can run on the temp-index write, and a
# reference-transaction hook runs on `git update-ref`. Because a clean filter can TRANSFORM worktree bytes
# before they enter the snapshot, the snapshot is NOT guaranteed byte-exact on a filtered repo. Further, a
# single overlaid tree cannot capture dirty content inside a SUBMODULE or an untracked EMBEDDED git repo (it
# stores only the gitlink), and it flattens staged-vs-unstaged into ONE tree. One JSONL line is appended to a
# per-user ledger normally OUTSIDE the repo (so a `git clean` inside the repo cannot destroy it); the write
# is BEST-EFFORT: normally one line per snapshot, but skipped when no per-user location resolves (absent
# HOME/XDG), when the path would land inside the repo (a misconfigured XDG_STATE_HOME/HOME), or when the
# directory/open/write fails. FAIL POSTURE: when a snapshot is warranted but cannot be made (probe/write
# error, an undecodable non-UTF-8 path, over the size cap, a bare or broken git dir, or a temp dir resolving
# inside the repo) the recovery layer NEVER lets that become a silent allow of a not-provably-clean discard -
# a would-be ALLOW is DOWNGRADED to ASK, and an already-ASK/DENY decision is left as-is with the failure
# surfaced in its reason. HONEST LIMITATION: the snapshot cannot capture what the probe cannot see (content
# hidden by assume-unchanged/skip-worktree marks or submodule.<name>.ignore), nor ignored files (git add
# --all excludes them), so a discard of that content is not recoverable here.

    -B force-create, switch incl -C/--force-create, restore/reset/clean/stash drop-clear/rm/branch force
    delete/move/copy/reset) the outcome is ASK unless the command
    is a PRISTINE SINGLE BARE 'git <verb>' invocation (see _pristine_single_bare_git: no shell metacharacter
    anywhere even quoted, no reserved word, no wrapper/redirect/compound, and the sole command word literally
    'git') AND either its FORM is genuinely non-destructive, or the working tree is PROVABLY CLEAN (the
    config-forced porcelain probe reports no tracked change AND no untracked entry), or the LEADING opt-out is
    set - in which cases ALLOW. A pristine single bare WHOLE-TREE clobber (reset --hard, checkout -f with no
    pathspec, switch --force/--discard-changes) on a probed-DIRTY tree DENIES. EVERYTHING ELSE in scope ASKS:
    any shell structure at all (a metacharacter, wrapper, redirect, reserved word, or second segment), an
    option the form-classifier cannot resolve, a worktree it cannot resolve to the session cwd, an incomplete
    probe, or a softer/index-only discard. No recognized lossy command that would discard WORKING-TREE CONTENT
    is silently ALLOWED unless it is a pristine
    bare git whose FORM is genuinely non-destructive (checkout -b, reset --soft, clean -n, which ALLOW even on
    a dirty tree), or on a provably-clean tree, or a pristine bare form carrying the leading
    GUARDRAIL_ALLOW_DISCARD=1 opt-out - worst case it ASKS; the guarantee is bounded to working-tree content
    (ref-level moves such as reset --soft moving HEAD or a merged-branch delete are reflog-recoverable) and is
    best-effort against the disclosed obfuscation/config residuals. Fail-open ALLOW is reserved for the TRUE boundary
    (a non-Bash or absent tool, a malformed or missing command it cannot read as a discard, a non-git command,
    or no recognized lossy verb). A wrapper is in scope only while the raw scan still
    sees a contiguous git verb keyword, so 'any wrapper ASKS' is NOT categorical: a wrapper that ALSO
    fragments the COMMAND WORD 'git' itself or the verb (env git re'set' --hard / eval git re'set' / command
    g'it' reset --hard, whose raw string carries no contiguous 'git'+'reset') reads as 'no recognized lossy
    verb' and is silently ALLOWED - a DISCLOSED best-effort residual, not chased. A real discard whose VERB is
    outside the recognized set AND unflagged by the raw scan ('git worktree remove -f' of a dirty linked
    worktree, where 'worktree' matches no lossy keyword) is allowed at the true boundary - disclosed, not
    closed this round. BUT a command the raw scan DOES flag whose resolved subcommand is outside the
    recognized set ('git checkout-index -a -f', 'git read-tree -u --reset HEAD') now ASKS (F-97): a flagged
    sub the classifier cannot resolve to a known verb cannot be proven non-destructive, so it never wins the
    catch-all allow. The status probe (git status --porcelain,
    config-forced to report untracked) is read-only and offline.

    SIDE-EFFECTING (EN-6 recovery layer): this handler is NO LONGER pure-decision. Before returning its
    decision for a snapshottable in-scope verb (checkout/switch/restore/reset/rm/clean) whose worktree it can
    resolve to the session cwd AND whose tree is NOT provably clean, it takes an INERT recovery snapshot of
    the uncommitted work (a private refs/aiqt-recovery/<utc-ts>-<pid> ref over a temp-index tree, git objects
    + one ref only) and BEST-EFFORT appends a line to an EXTERNAL per-user ledger (normally one per snapshot;
    skipped when no per-user location resolves, the path would land inside the repo, or the write fails), on
    the ALLOW and ASK paths alike (the hook fires once, with no post-approval callback). It NEVER mutates the real index, worktree, HEAD, or any
    branch. If a warranted snapshot cannot be made, a would-be ALLOW is downgraded to ASK ('no recovery point
    could be created'); an already-ASK/DENY decision is left as-is with the failure surfaced. F-D EXPANSION: a
    NON-PRISTINE in-scope ASK (a compound/wrapped/redirected snapshottable command) is ALSO snapshot-backed
    BEST-EFFORT against the SESSION CWD repo (the redirected dir of a non-pristine command is not parsed, so a
    command that changes into a DIFFERENT repo may be snapshotted at the session repo rather than the target;
    a same-repo cd is still captured by the whole-tree add --all). See the recovery block comment above
    _SNAPSHOTTABLE_VERBS. The snapshot cannot capture what the probe cannot see (assume-unchanged/skip-worktree
    marks, submodule.<name>.ignore) or ignored files (git add --all excludes them), so a discard of that

    --prune (round-4: it DELETES every remote branch absent locally, with NO force flag - witnessed
    deleting a remote master through a wildcard refspec - and the caller judges it against the refspec
    shape); operands is the remote/refspec token list in command order. The option region is split from
    the operand region at the first '--'/'--end-of-options' boundary via the shipped _split_pre_post, so
    an operand that merely looks like an option ('git push origin -- --force') is never read as one; post
    tokens extend operands AFTER the loop, preserving command order. Flag detection is VALUE-AWARE (F-112

    short '-f'/'-d' cluster scan, so an abbreviated '--for' or '--d' - even one git itself would reject

    git accepts only ATTACHED (gitcli(7) stuck form), and --force-if-includes takes no value at all, so
    none of the three ever consumes a following token and none is in the skip sets. Negation and no-op
    flags are NOT modelled (round-4, disclosed): '--no-force'/'--no-delete' cancel nothing here,
    '--force-if-includes' alone (a documented no-op without --force-with-lease) still reads as force,
    and --dry-run is judged like the real thing - all safe-direction over-denies; re-issue without the

# --- secsec: an obvious hardcoded secret in a Write/Edit/MultiEdit/Bash write-form -------------------
# A COMPENSATING, shift-left control: it does NOT replace the CI secret-scan and gitleaks gates (they
# remain the real backstop), it moves the same high-signal detection to the moment a secret would be
# written, so an accidental paste is caught before it ever lands on disk. The patterns are SINGLE-SOURCED
# from tools/check_secrets.py, the pack's source of truth: the PREFIX provider-token shapes, the
# credential-named ASSIGN shape, and the PLACEHOLDER non-secret shape are rendered into the GENERATED
# REGION below by tools/gen_secret_patterns.py (drift-gated), so the hook can never fork from the scanner
# and the standalone plugin needs no runtime import of check_secrets (it stays stdlib-only). The decision
# mirrors check_secrets.py EXACTLY, scanning line by line: a provider-prefix match is a hit; a
# credential-named assignment is a hit only when its value is real (an unquoted value must carry both a
# letter and a digit) AND is not a PLACEHOLDER. The secret value is NEVER echoed into a reason; only the
# pattern label is named. Best-effort, targeting the accidental paste/commit, not an adversary: it does
# NOT catch an entropy-only secret with no recognizable shape, a secret written by a tool other than
# Write/Edit/MultiEdit/Bash, or a secret split across tokens/lines or built by concatenation; on the
# Bash path the command string is scanned as RAW TEXT (not tokenized by the shared lexer, not executed), so a secret
# assembled by concatenation or supplied through a shell variable or expansion is missed, but a redirect
# or an embedded '#' does NOT cause a Bash-path miss; and it does not catch a base64/obfuscated form.
#
# The pattern SOURCE STRINGS below are GENERATED from tools/check_secrets.py by
# tools/gen_secret_patterns.py and are drift-gated; NEVER hand-edit them, and NEVER runtime-import
# check_secrets. Edit tools/check_secrets.py and regenerate (gen_secret_patterns.py, then gen_hooks.py).

    edit touches; the block drift gates backstop those).

    ABSENT (FileNotFoundError from the lstat probe: ENOENT on the file or a missing .aiqt/ component) is
    the inert boundary: a repo with no registry gets no coverage (adopters author their own). Every OTHER
    read fault is BAD, never absent, so an unreadable input can never read as clean (integ-check-fails-
    closed-on-unreadable): a registry that is not a regular file (a symlink dangling or redirecting, a
    FIFO, a directory, a socket, a device; not a trusted regular file), a
    PermissionError/NotADirectoryError/IsADirectoryError, a non-UTF-8 decode, an oversize file (the bound

    Per-entry validation mirrors _canonical_target (tools/gen_gensrc.py:193-213), because gen_gensrc's
    validation only guarantees THIS repo's registry; an adopter-authored or hand-tampered registry the
    guard cannot fully read is BAD (it cannot prove no-match). Unknown extra keys within version 1 are
    tolerated: the version field pins the schema, and strictness on additions would break a
    forward-compatibly authored registry. This loader is BEST-EFFORT against the ACCIDENTAL case, not a
    hardened TOCTOU check: it rejects a STATIONARY non-regular registry and fails a delete race safe to
    BAD, but a registry concurrently SWAPPED to a different file type in the lstat-to-open window is a

    persisted checkpoint (<state_dir>/backlog-checkpoint.json) against the FULL validated payload
    (closed rows included: a closed row is the receipt that lets an id leave the checkpoint) and
    returns the cannot-evaluate rows to inject: an id recorded eligible or proposed that is absent from
    the payload entirely with no closed receipt (vanished), OR (FIX 2) an id recorded eligible now
    DEMOTED to proposed/ungranted with no closed receipt, is HELD rather than silently shrunk or
    demoted away. An unreadable or malformed checkpoint injects ONE marker row and is
    rewritten fresh. The rewritten checkpoint is the union of prior unreceipted eligible/proposed ids and
    this payload's, bounded at _ORCH_CHECKPOINT_MAX with a bound-forced drop logged to guard-events.
    Verdict effects are entirely existing branches (FIX 1: the stop path DENIES on an injected
    cannot-evaluate, the schedule path denies bounded by the cap); this helper adds no new deny logic, and a failed rewrite
    changes no verdict.

    record=False is the PREVIEW posture (tools/orch_preflight.py): the vanished-id injections are still
    COMPUTED for display, but NO checkpoint rewrite, init-marker write, or guard-event is emitted, so a
    preview makes no state change.

    FIX 4: an absent checkpoint is a legitimate FIRST window only when no prior window was ever
    initialised. When the durable init marker shows a prior window but the checkpoint is now gone, that
    is a possible reset (naive deletion or a crash) and is HELD (cannot-evaluate), never silently
    restarted. RESIDUAL (disclosed): the marker lives in the same actor-writable state dir, so this
    raises the bar (catches naive deletion) without being categorical. The checkpoint's eligibility memory (the FIX 2 demotion catch) lives in the same actor-writable state dir, so it raises the bar without being categorical."""

    pipe-stderr operators, any single-quoted, double-quoted, or backslash-escaped ampersand, and an `&`
    inside an unquoted, word-start `#` comment (comment text, not an operator). A dedicated quote- and
    escape-tracking scan is used, NOT _segments: that helper strips quote and escape provenance and

    comment never suppresses a later line, so a real bare `&` on a subsequent line of a multi-line command

    quoting, can leave the scan `inside quotes` and skip a real trailing `&`), so it reports a detach
    (True -> ASK) rather than allowing. A genuinely balanced, quoted `&` is literal and correctly ignored.

    NARROW BY CONSTRUCTION: this scans for the accidental bare-operator case only. Grammar it does not
    model (a here-document body, a nested shell string, an alias or function that renames a detacher, and
    runtime detachers such as nohup/setsid/disown/coproc) is a disclosed residual; where such a construct
    still leaves an unquoted bare `&`, or leaves the scan inside an unbalanced quote, it errs toward the
    ASK, but a detacher that carries no bare `&` (setsid worker, a nested `bash -c '... &'`) is NOT caught

# metric), the scrubbed git primitive
# (_recovery_toplevel), and the
# gensrc containment/loader idiom (_gensrc_within, the lstat->S_ISREG->byte-bound->UTF-8->JSON taxonomy).
# TWO arming inputs, each fail-open on ABSENCE only: the per-slice declaration (slice confinement) and the
# committed frozen floor (frozen denial). The structural other-repo/nested-repo denial applies to every
# covered write whose repository root resolves (a covered write whose root cannot be resolved is DENIED, not
# allowed); the frozen-floor denial fires whenever a floor is present, and an armed session additionally
# requires one, so an un-armed session with a genuinely-absent floor is inert there. Only slice confinement
# is fail-open on a missing declaration. Once armed, every cannot-evaluate resolves to DENY. See the

    set, wowo01 (workers-produce-inert-data) as the apply-stage discipline over the sole writer, and exetgt
    (confirm-execution-target): the other-repo denial is its mechanical form for writes.

    TWO arming inputs, each fail-open on ABSENCE only. The per-slice declaration
    <state_dir>/write-scope.json (at the registry-declared state_dir, out of the slice tree by default) arms
    SLICE CONFINEMENT (absent -> un-armed, inert confinement; present -> armed, every uncertainty denies).
    The in-tree committed frozen floor .aiqt/frozen.json arms the FROZEN layer (absent -> the frozen layer is
    inert un-armed; present -> the floor is enforced). The structural other-repo/nested-repo denial applies
    to every covered write whose repository root resolves, and a covered write whose root CANNOT be resolved
    is denied (fail-closed), not allowed. The root is resolved FIRST, so this unresolvable-root denial
    precedes any relative-path handling (a non-git relative-path write denies, it does not defer); only once
    the root resolves does an un-armed relative path defer to the sibling absolute_paths hook. The
    frozen-floor denial fires whenever a floor is PRESENT, and an
    armed session additionally REQUIRES a floor (an armed session with a genuinely-absent floor denies); only
    an un-armed session with a genuinely-absent floor leaves the frozen layer inert, so the frozen denial is
    not unconditionally always-on. Slice confinement is fail-open on a missing declaration; the principled
    fail-open is genuine ABSENCE (of a declaration or floor: no confinement in effect, the same inert
    boundary gensrc and the orchestration suite use). A cannot-evaluate FAULT is not absence: a resolution
    or probe ERROR (an unresolvable session root, a root or target canonicalization fault, a containment
    fault, or a nested-repo probe fault) on a covered write DENIES whether or not the session is armed, and
    never allows an unverified write; and once armed every cannot-evaluate resolves to DENY. Out-of-scope is a DENY, never an ASK:
    an ASK would hand the confined actor the click-through on its own confinement and would wedge an
    unattended run; the remedy is the harness re-declaring the slice. The declaration is machine-set inert
    data, never authored by the assistant through a guarded tool; the residual Bash-write path to the state
    dir is defence in depth, not categorical (disclosed below).

    RESIDUAL (disclose-guard-residuals): a PATH guard, not a content judge; it decides where a write lands,
    never what it writes. Covers only PreToolUse Write/Edit/MultiEdit carrying a readable file_path.
    Bash-mediated writes (redirects, sed -i, cp, mv, tee, an editor launched in Bash), NotebookEdit,
    filesystem MCP tools, and any write outside the platform's hook path are NOT caught; the committed frozen
    floor .aiqt/frozen.json is a generated, drift-gated output backstopped at merge by the manifest-gen-drift
    gate (tools/gen_manifest.py --check), the gensrc-registry-drift gate (tools/gen_gensrc.py --check), and
    the independent manifest-integrity verifier (tools/check_manifest.py), but nothing backstops an
    uncommitted, out-of-scope-mutable, or cross-repository write through those channels. The declaration is
    machine-local and session-scoped (CI cannot observe it). Realpath closes symlink escapes present at check
    time but not a post-check swap, hard-link alias, or bind-mount change (TOCTOU); an OS-level write sandbox
    is the stronger overlapping control. The floor is enforced against the manifest CLASS set {derived,
    manifest-self, archive}. That floor's RUNTIME value is un-lowerable by the constrained actor through the
    guarded tools (a guarded Write/Edit/MultiEdit to .aiqt/frozen.json is itself on the floor and denied);
    but its DEFINITION (FROZEN_CLASSES in tools/gen_manifest.py) is generator source that lands through
    pull-request review PLUS the drift gate, which detects an INCONSISTENT floor (a committed frozen.json
    that does not match a fresh regeneration), NOT an unauthorized-but-internally-consistent redefinition of
    the class set followed by regeneration. An independent floor-authorization mechanism is out of this
    hook's scope. The floor proves membership in its declared selector set only, not that the generation-time
