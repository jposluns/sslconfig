"""Fail on en dashes and em dashes in Markdown prose and the standards id-manifests.

The project's writing style forbids both; hyphens, commas, colons, semicolons,
and parentheses are the sanctioned substitutes. Markdown and the crosswalk
manifests under .aiqt/standards/ are scanned (the manifest titles are public
crosswalk text); this Python file is not, so it may name the characters in its
own source without flagging itself.
